# Project Summary
The Requirements Estimation System is a web application aimed at helping users accurately estimate the development efforts required for project requirements. It provides a structured and repeatable process that benefits Project Managers, Tech Leads, and freelancers by streamlining project planning and budgeting. The system integrates multiple technology stacks, including Power Platform, Java, .NET, and React, and leverages AI to enhance activity suggestions.

# Project Module Description
- **Home Wizard**: A streamlined 5-step wizard for users to input requirement details and select technology without needing to log in.
- **AI Activity Suggestions**: Utilizes OpenAI to offer relevant activity suggestions based on user-defined requirements (requires a valid OpenAI API key).
- **Deterministic Calculation Engine**: Calculates total effort based on selected activities, drivers, and risks using a transparent formula.
- **Authentication System**: Employs Supabase for user management and secure access to projects.
- **Lists Management**: Allows users to create and manage estimation projects, ensuring data isolation with Row Level Security.

# Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd shadcn-ui
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Setup Database**:
   - Create a Supabase project and execute `supabase_schema.sql` and `supabase_seed.sql` in the SQL editor.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in your Supabase and OpenAI credentials. Ensure to replace the placeholder for `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
