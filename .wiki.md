# Project Summary
The Requirements Estimation System is a web application designed to assist users in estimating development efforts for requirements in a structured and repeatable manner. It supports multiple technology stacks, including Power Platform, Java, .NET, and React, while utilizing AI for activity suggestions. The system is particularly beneficial for Project Managers, Tech Leads, and freelancers, providing essential tools for project planning, budgeting, and standardized estimation processes.

# Project Module Description
- **Home Wizard**: A user-friendly 5-step estimation wizard that allows users to input requirement details and select technology without requiring a login.
- **AI Activity Suggestions**: Integrates OpenAI to suggest relevant activities based on requirement descriptions (requires a valid OpenAI API key).
- **Deterministic Calculation Engine**: Computes total effort based on selected activities, drivers, and risks using a transparent formula.
- **Authentication System**: Utilizes Supabase for user management and secure access to projects.
- **Lists Management**: Enables users to create and manage estimation projects, with Row Level Security ensuring data isolation.

# Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd shadcn-ui
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Setup Database**:
   - Create a Supabase project and execute `supabase_schema.sql` and `supabase_seed.sql` in the SQL editor.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in your Supabase and OpenAI credentials. Ensure to replace the placeholder for `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
