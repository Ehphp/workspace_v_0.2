# Project Summary
The Requirements Estimation System is a web application designed to help users estimate development efforts for requirements in a structured and repeatable way. It supports various technology stacks (Power Platform, Java, .NET, React) and leverages AI for activity suggestions while ensuring accurate effort estimation through a deterministic calculation engine. This system is particularly useful for Project Managers, Tech Leads, and freelancers, offering tools for project planning, budgeting, and standardized estimation processes.

# Project Module Description
- **Home Wizard**: A 5-step estimation wizard accessible without login, allowing users to input requirement details and select technology.
- **AI Activity Suggestions**: Integrates OpenAI to suggest relevant activities based on requirement descriptions (requires valid OpenAI API key).
- **Deterministic Calculation Engine**: Calculates total effort based on selected activities, drivers, and risks using a transparent formula.
- **Authentication System**: Built with Supabase for user management and secure access to projects.
- **Lists Management**: Allows users to create and manage estimation projects, with Row Level Security ensuring data isolation.

# Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd shadcn-ui
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Setup Database**:
   - Create a Supabase project and execute `supabase_schema.sql` and `supabase_seed.sql` in the SQL editor.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in your Supabase and OpenAI credentials. Ensure to replace the placeholder for `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
